Each dropdown menu has an onchange event that triggers the calculateTotal function to update the total price dynamically.
A submit button triggers the submitOrder function to alert the user with the total price upon submission.
CSS Styling:

The form uses Bulma CSS framework for styling.
Additional custom CSS is included to set the maximum width of the container and style the total price display.
JavaScript Functions:

calculateTotal function calculates the total price based on selected component prices and updates the total price display.
submitOrder function shows an alert with the total price when the order is submitted.
